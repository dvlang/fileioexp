Professor:

The program as compiled in MSVScommunity2017 v 15.2

The program will run the first time  and create a data.dat file in the directory to save the current date. 
You will see and error the first time it runs.

account data file should be "accounts.dat" 

I believe all the user functionality is in the project and not too peculiar.

I did not assess a transaction fee for viewing only.  This just didn't seem right.

I've included the part1 files, but I do believe part 2 to be complete.
